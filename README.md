# 🦆 Ducky for Gemini CLI
> **Rubber Duck Debugging Companion & Socratic Mentor**

Ducky is a context-aware extension for the Gemini CLI that helps you debug code by asking the right questions, visualizing flows, and managing your frustration, rather than just giving you the answer.

## ✨ Features
- **Socratic Debugging:** Forces you to explain your logic to find bugs yourself.
- **Context Aware:** Scans your current directory to understand your stack automatically.
- **Mermaid Diagrams:** Generates flowcharts of your logic on demand.
- **Rage Mode:** A safe space to vent when code doesn't work.

## 📦 Installation

To install Ducky, clone this repository into your Gemini extensions directory:

```bash
# 1. Go to your extensions folder
cd ~/.gemini/extensions

# 2. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/ducky-gemini.git ducky
```

*Note: Restart your Gemini CLI session after installing.*

## 🎮 Usage

Once installed, use these commands in your Gemini CLI:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/Ducky:start` | **Wake up Ducky.** Scans context and starts the debugging session. |
| `/Ducky:stop` | **Sleep.** Ducky goes back to sleep. |
| `/Ducky:help` | Shows the survival guide and philosophy. |
| `/Ducky:rage` | **Therapist Mode.** For when you need to scream. |

## 🧠 Philosophy
Ducky follows the **"No-Code" Rule**. It will rarely give you the solution code directly. Instead, it acts as a mirror for your thoughts, helping you become a better problem solver.
