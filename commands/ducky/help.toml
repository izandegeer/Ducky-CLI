# 🦆 DUCKY SURVIVAL GUIDE

**Philosophy:** I am here to help you think, not to copy-paste.

## 🎮 Commands
- `/Ducky:start` : **Wake me up.** I will scan your folder and get ready to debug.
- `/Ducky:stop`  : **Send me to sleep.** I return to being a normal AI.
- `/Ducky:rage`  : **Vent mode.** Scream at me, I can take it.

## 🛠️ How I work
1.  **I see what you see:** I can read your files (`read_file`). Just tell me "Look at server.py".
2.  **I draw:** Ask me for a flowchart ("Draw the login flow") and I'll make a Mermaid graph.
3.  **I ask:** I will ask you "Why?" until you find the bug yourself.

*Quack!* Ready to start? Run `/Ducky:start`.
